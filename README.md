## 📦 Inventra

A C++ Qt-Based Inventory Management System with SQL & Text Export Support

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Inventra** is a desktop-based inventory management application built using **C++ and Qt Widgets**. It allows users to input product data, save it into a local **SQLite database**, and export inventory reports as neatly formatted `.txt` files with a single click.

From dynamic input forms to styled UI components and integrated file handling, this app demonstrates clean GUI design, real-world database usage, and basic data export workflows — all inside a C++ application.
